## Cube Drone!

That's me!

I'm a Vancouver software developer, cartoonist, indie game developer, writer,
that sort of thing. 

You might know me from:

* The [popular Virtual Reality platform](https://hello.vrchat.com/) I've been working at as a lead developer for approximately one decade. 
* A [blog?](https://blog.cube-drone.com/) Who still has a blog in this day and age?
* [CardChapter](https://cardchapter.com/). It's... hard to explain. 
* Some [comics I wrote a long time ago](http://comics.cube-drone.com).
* The wildly popular [Drone-Ver](http://dronever.cube-drone.com/) Versioning Scheme.
* A lot of defunct, experimental, no-longer-operational video games and websites, most of which at their very best had no more than a handful of users.
