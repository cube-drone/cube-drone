      # Hi, I'm Cube Drone

      I'm a Vancouver software developer, cartoonist, and weird nerd.

      You might remember me from:

      * The [Virtual Reality platform](https://hello.vrchat.com/) I've been working at as a lead developer for approximately one decade. 
      * [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@cube_drone), the social network for neurodivergent distributed FOSS perverts, furry anarchists, and savage internecine moderation feuds.

      ## Some More Stuff
      #
      * A [blog?](https://blog.cube-drone.com/) Who still has a blog in this day and age?
      * [CardChapter](https://cardchapter.com/). It's... hard to explain. 
      * Some [comics I wrote a long time ago](http://comics.cube-drone.com).
      * The wildly popular [Drone-Ver](http://dronever.cube-drone.com/) Versioning Scheme.
      * A lot of defunct, experimental, no-longer-operational video games and websites, most of which at their very best had no more than a handful of users.

      ## This is Too Much Content for an Introductory Page

      Seriously, why are you still scrolling? Even my own
      mother doesn't want to get to know me _that_ badly.

      Uh... I like... [vim keybindings](https://vim.rtorr.com/). 

      And ... rain? 

      I host my entire playlist as an [icecast station](https://radio.marquee.click/)
      so that I have access to it everywhere I go?

      I cook pretty well?

      ## On Handles
      It may seem very, uh, _1995_ to have an [_internet handle_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlMvYx11V-Y). 
      But I stand by it. 

      I picked the name when I worked in a gigantic cubicle farm for a major telecommunications company.
      It's not as representative of my personality now as it was when I chose it - but
      I own the domain name and it's my handle on all kinds of social media, so I'm stuck with it.

          ## Wait, Is That a Substack? 
          Yeah, I know - [blog.cube-drone.com](https://blog.cube-drone.com) is on Substack and Substack 
          is terrible, both because of the awful people they platform 
          and the terrifying amount of money they
          owe to VC legbreakers. I should host my blog myself. I will, eventually, probably.
